# Graph Neural Network (GNN)

Convolutional filters usually are rectangle-shaped (or cuboid) and they work on rectangular grids. Thus, the operator has limitations of locality and grid shapes. To overcome the problem, we redefine the relationship between points (nodes) in form of an adjacency matrix, which can access the points that we want whenever the convolutional operation is conducted at a point. As a practice, we predict the MNIST dataset using Graph Neural Network (GNN). The performance of this model is comparable to CNNs.
